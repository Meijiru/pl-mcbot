# PloudOS On Discord 

A simple tool to serve your own discord bot, so you can manage an PloudOS server from discord.

## Prerequisites

* Python 3.7 or higher
* A Discord server for which you have the rights to add a bot
* An PloudOS account

## Discord Commands

* --launch
* --status
* --info
* --players
* --stop
* --help


## Cloud Hosting Note

Cloud hosting this bot would require some workarounds as Aternos recognizes you are connecting from a data center and prompts for a captcha test.
